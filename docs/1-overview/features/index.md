#### Transferring data  

DX automates the cumbersome process of transferring data your instance. You don't need APIs, IP addresses, security keys, or copy protocols. Instead, you can select any of your stored data and DX will automatically and quickly add it to your instance.

#### Reproducing workloads

DX makes it possible and easy to reproduce a computation or workflow by recreating the identical infrastructure components and re-deploying the workloads's identical containers and data for you.

#### GPU computing

DX makes it easy to use GPUs in any of your computations. By using Docker images with GPU support built-in, DX automatically handles the integration and runtime for you. In other words, you get to use GPUs just as easy as any other computation on Tenzar DX.

#### Running Docker containers

DX makes it easy for you to run Docker containers by automatically handling the runtime logic when you launch an instance. DX makes it possible for you to run most Linux based containers without the need for you to learn how to use Docker.


#### Storing data

DX enables you to securely store as much data as you need. DX automatically secures and encrypts your data at rest and in transit, while also automatically expanding the size of your storage capacity.

DX offers advanced, cost-reducing, data storage services available through on-demand through our professional team.

#### Privately store Docker images

DX makes it easy for you to import public Docker images from DockerHub into your own private DX Image Registry. DX's Image Registry also supports private image uploads via the Tenzar Terminal command line interface.

#### Inviting other members to your team

DX makes collaboration easy by allowing you to invite members into your team.

Members that you add to your team can use data shared across your team, as well as any Docker images and instances to streamline collaboration. DX streamlines traditional collaboration by providing a unified computing interface for your team without requiring you (or your IT team) to configure multiple infrastructures or manage your user's devices.

#### Uploading data

DX makes it easy to upload large data through the Tenzar Terminal's fast and network failure tolerant uploader (e.g. if you lose internet connection, you can resume the upload without losing previous progress).

DX supports terabyte size single files or uploads that can be stopped and resumed at your convenience.
