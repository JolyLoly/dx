### What you can do with Tenzar DX

Tenzar DX is a computing system with a comprehensive set of features that allows users to quickly adopt cloud computing, share data, and run computational workloads in minutes.


#### Running a computation

DX makes it easy to deploy a workload to the cloud by automatically launching your instance, running your container, and transferring your data.

#### Transferring data  

DX automates the cumbersome process of transferring data your instance. You don't need APIs, IP addresses, security keys, or copy protocols. Instead, you simply select the data you need and DX will automatically add it to your instance. DX uses proprietary technology to speed up data transfers and best-practice security to ensure your data is safe.

#### Reproducing workloads

DX makes it easy to reproduce a computation or workflow by recreating the identical infrastructure components and re-deploying the workload's identical containers and data for you.

#### GPU computing

DX makes it easy to use GPUs in any of your computations. By using Docker images with GPU support built-in, DX automatically handles the integration and runtime for you. In other words, using GPUs is just as easy as any other computation on Tenzar DX.

#### Running Docker containers

DX makes it easy to run Docker containers on an instance by automatically handling all the runtime logic. DX makes it possible for you to run most Linux based containers without the need to learn Docker.


#### Storing data

DX enables you to securely store as much data as you need. DX automatically secures and encrypts your data at rest and in transit, while also expanding the size of your storage capacity as needed.

DX offers advanced, cost-reducing, data storage services available through on-demand through our professional team.

#### Privately store Docker images

DX makes it easy to import public Docker images from DockerHub into your own private DX Image Registry. The DX Image Registry also supports private image uploads via the Tenzar Terminal command line interface.

#### Inviting other members to your team

DX makes collaboration easy by allowing you to invite members into your team.

Members that you add to your team can use any data shared across your team, as well as any Docker images and instances. DX streamlines traditional collaboration by providing a unified computing interface for your team without requiring you (or your IT team) to configure multiple infrastructures or manage your user's devices.

#### Uploading data

DX makes it easy to upload large data through the Tenzar Terminal's fast and efficient uploader. The uploader is robust to network errors and failures, meaning if you lose internet connection, you can resume the upload from where you left off, and the uploader will ensure no data was lost.

DX supports terabyte size single files or uploads that can be stopped and resumed at your convenience.
