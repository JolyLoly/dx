### Using Tenzar DX

DX provides two ways of interacting with it: a rich graphical web Dashboard accessible at [dx.tenzar.com](https://dx.tenzar.com) and the Tenzar Terminal, a powerful command line interface built for Linux and macOS.

The Dashboard and Tenzar Terminal provide similar functionalities of Tenzar DX. However, there are some actions that are only supported by the Dashboard and there are some other actions that are only supported by the Tenzar Terminal. For example, *uploads*, *downloads*, and *connections* to your deployments are not supported via the Web Dashboard.
