### What is Tenzar DX?

Tenzar DX is a computing system for collaboration and easy deployment of computational workloads in the cloud.

DX is a software layer that runs on top of data centers, abstracting all of the building blocks supplied by cloud infrastructure providers. It provides a universal interface for launching computations, sharing and storing data, collaborating, and more.

### What Tenzar DX is not

Tenzar DX is not another cloud provider and it is not hosted on data centers owned by Tenzar. Instead, DX is a computing system that runs on top of a cloud provider's data centers (e.g. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) in order to efficiently operate and manage the underlying infrastructure for you.

The Tenzar DX system is powered by the DX Compute Engine, which is responsible for accelerating data transfers and optimizing the performance of data center resources.


### Who it's for?

DX is a seamless high-performance computing system for data scientists, researchers, IT teams, and developers. DX is designed to have a familiar interface that is easy to learn and easy to use. It allows you to run workloads in the cloud or other infrastructure without APIs, SDKs, or other complex integrations.

DX was built as a multi-purpose, language-agnostic computing system capable of running small to terabyte-scale workloads. DX's generality enables you to run your workloads without modifying your code or adhering to a restrictive configuration "style", as enforced by other platforms.

##### Most common uses of DX:
- Machine Learning
- Bioinformatics / Genomics
- Data Processing
- Data Science
- Scientific Computing
- Data and Compute Collaboration
